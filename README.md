## Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of financial markets. However, by analyzing historical data and incorporating various techniques, it is possible to make informed predictions about future price movements. This project aims to leverage ARIMA, ARCH, and LSTM models to forecast stock prices accurately. By providing insights into potential price trends, investors can make informed decisions and manage their portfolios more effectively.

## Project Overview

The Stock Price Prediction project combines several techniques to predict future stock prices. It includes the following key components:

- **ARIMA Model**: Contains the code for building and training an ARIMA model to capture the time series patterns and forecast stock prices.
- **ARCH Model**: Includes the code for constructing and training an ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to capture volatility clustering and forecast future volatility.
- **LSTM Model**: Contains the code for building and training an LSTM model to capture temporal dependencies in the data and predict stock prices.
- **Data Retrieval**: Includes scripts and utilities to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance from 2010 onwards, using their APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Contains functions to preprocess the retrieved data, handle missing values, and scale features before feeding them into the models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes functions to evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the step-by-step implementation of the models and their evaluation on example datasets.

## Installation

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Stock-Price-Prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models on your own stock price data, follow the steps below:

1. Retrieve the historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance or any other reliable source. You can use the provided data retrieval scripts or implement your own data fetching mechanism.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and transforming it into a suitable format for model training.
3. Choose the appropriate model for your prediction task (ARIMA, ARCH, or LSTM) and modify the corresponding script or notebook to fit your data.
4. Train the model using the prepared data:

```bash
python train.py
```

5. Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

6. Adjust the model parameters, data preprocessing steps, or hyperparameters as needed to improve performance.

## Data

For training and evaluating the stock price prediction models, you need historical stock price data. The data can be obtained from various financial data providers, but in this project

, we retrieve it directly from Yahoo Finance using their APIs.

You can use the provided data retrieval scripts to fetch historical data for the desired stock symbols. Ensure that the data includes the following columns:

- `Date`: The date of the stock price data point.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
- `High`: The highest price reached during the trading day.
- `Low`: The lowest price reached during the trading day.
- `Close`: The closing price of the stock.
- `Volume`: The trading volume of the stock.

It is recommended to have a sufficient amount of historical data to capture meaningful patterns and trends.

## Model Architecture

This project employs various models to predict stock prices:

- **ARIMA Model**: The ARIMA model is a classic time series forecasting model that combines autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), and moving average (MA) components. It captures the temporal dependencies in the data and predicts future stock prices based on historical patterns.
- **ARCH Model**: The ARCH model focuses on capturing the volatility clustering in financial time series. It models the conditional variance of the data based on past observations and provides insights into future volatility, which can be useful for risk management and trading strategies.
- **LSTM Model**: The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is well-suited for predicting stock prices as it can learn from historical trends and patterns to make accurate future predictions.

Each model has its own advantages and assumptions, and the choice of model depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific requirements of the prediction task.

## Evaluation

The performance of the stock price prediction models can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics measure the average squared difference between the predicted stock prices and the actual prices. Lower values indicate better performance.

In addition to numerical evaluation, it is essential to visually analyze the predicted stock price trends and compare them with the actual price movements. Visualization techniques such as line plots and candlestick charts can provide valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
